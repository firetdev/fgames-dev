- 👋 Hi, I’m @fgames-dev (Future Games)
- 👀 I’m interested in web and game development, and I use Godot as well as my own game engine, InstantJS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and 3D game development in Godot. I know and use over 13 languages, so it's hard to keep track.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on JavaScript games, Debian, and InstantJS
- 📫 How to reach me: I am often in school, but when I'm not busy doing schoolwork and other stuff, you can reach me by going to https://future-games.site, my website.
Sorry if I don't respond, I am still in middle school so I am often offline :)
